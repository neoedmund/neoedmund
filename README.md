### Leaving github

Why not forced 2FA?
- More personal data
- more inconvenience
- little gain in "security"

What github gives me
- free OSS hosting
- 400+ stars on my main project `neoeedit`, the text editor
- Vanity in showing creation
- Expecting good for job applications, but so far most interviewers just sneer at it, for whatever reason, God knows.

What about all the wonderful projects on Github?
- Github has changed, the world has changed, we all need changes. I will find them anyway.







### âš¡ an open source outlaw âš¡ 

Survival rules:

1. don't make pull-request
2. make forks

There are all kinds of things in the world, none merge back to origin. Just keep whatever you like.


__Don't take rules from people, listen to God.__
